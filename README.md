Civil Bridge Dashboard is a modern, responsive web application designed to connect citizens with local authorities for faster resolution of civic issues. The dashboard provides users with an intuitive interface to view important statistics, browse nearby reported problems via a smooth sliding carousel, and submit new civic issue reports through a user-friendly form.

The navigation bar includes quick links to different sections such as Stats, Nearby Problems, Report Problem, Chat, and Logout, ensuring easy access to all features. The hero section welcomes users and highlights the purpose of the platform — bridging the communication gap between citizens and authorities.

A standout feature is the horizontally sliding carousel that showcases reported problems in the user’s vicinity with details on the issue and location, helping users stay informed about community concerns. The report form allows users to submit new issues with fields for their name, email, problem title, description, and an optional image upload.

Upon submitting a report, a custom-styled popup thanks the user for their submission and redirects them to the login page, enhancing the user experience beyond the default browser alerts.

Additionally, the dashboard includes a collapsible chat popup for quick AI-assisted communication, providing basic replies and support.

Overall, the Civil Bridge Dashboard offers a clean, accessible, and engaging platform for civic issue reporting and community interaction.
